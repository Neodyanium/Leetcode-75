/**
 * Since we want the greatest common divisor we consider that there exists a substring that divides both the
 * Strings.
 * we will work with this example
 * s1 = "ABABAB" , s2 = "ABAB"
 *
 * we will be interating for the smaller length among both strings , it doesn;t matter much though because the gcd
 * string is to exist both of them, since we want it to be greatest we check it from last index.
 *
 * the for loop starts with the last index and it is then passed to the helper function which checks whether the
 * string is valid, if it is then that string till that particular index is returned by the gcd function, if not even
 * a single character matches then an empty string is returned. It will iterate and each time the i is reduced by 1
 * so as to provide decreasing substring that might be the answer, it is kept >= 1 because we want atleast a size of
 * string to compare is 1, if we include 0, out logic will give division / 0 exception
 *
 * isValid function is a boolean function,
 * a basic validation check will first happen, it is clear that the gcd string is the exist in both the strings and
 * it can be present any number of times, in our taken example we know the output should be AB and we can see that AB
 * does exist 3 times in string s1 and 2 times in string s2. This same principe is used is here, if any substring we
 * are looking at is not able to divide both string 1 and string 2 then it can't be the answer hence return false
 *
 * Now if it does divide both the strings, then we have a contendor for the gcd to exist, so the last line creates a
 * base string which is substring till that index and we use a replace function on both the string s1 and s2 and
 * replace the substring with "", and naturally if it is the gcd the strings will become empty and if both did become
 * empty then that substring is gcd and we can return true, so whether such gcd exist depend on both string after
 * replace we have returned the same.
 *
 * Time Complexity
 * Outer Loop (gcdOfStrings):
 * The loop iterates from min(str1.length(), str2.length()) down to 1, making at most O(N) iterations, where N = min(len(str1), len(str2)).
 *
 * isValid Function:
 * Checking l1 % k and l2 % k takes O(1) time.
 * Extracting base = s1.substring(0, k) takes O(k).
 * Using replace() to check divisibility:
 * s1.replace(base, "") and s2.replace(base, "") take O(len(s1) / k + len(s2) / k) in the worst case.
 * This results in O(len(s1) / k + len(s2) / k) = O(N / k + M / k), where N = len(s1), M = len(s2).
 * Since k can range from 1 to min(N, M), this can sum up to O(N + M) in the worst case.
 *
 * Overall Complexity:
 * The worst case occurs when gcdOfStrings runs O(N) times and isValid takes O(N + M) for each check.
 * This results in an O(N Ã— (N + M)) complexity in the worst case.
 *
 * Space Complexity
 * O(min(m,n)) it's for the base string we used
 *
